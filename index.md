![Profile photo of Tim](/assets/images/tim.png){: style="width: 30%; float: right; padding-left: 5%; padding-bottom: 5%;"}

I am a doctoral candidate in Informatics at [Universität Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"}, Germany, affiliated with the [MAST](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/mast/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"} research group, specializing in software engineering research.
Additionally, I am associated with the interdisciplinary graduate school [DASHH](https://www.dashh.org){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"} and the research facility [European XFEL](https://www.xfel.eu/index_eng.html){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noreferrer"}, home to the world's largest X-ray laser.

I received a Master's _(2021, passed with distinction)_ and a Bachelor's degree _(2019)_ in Informatics from Universität Hamburg.
Before my studies, I have completed an apprenticeship as IT specialist for application development _(2016, best in class)_ in a company near my hometown, Jena.

My surname can be hard to spell and pronounce, even for Germans.
Feel free to use the international version of my surname, ___Puhlfuerss___, to save time finding _ü_ and _ß_ on your keyboard.

## Research interests

__Software Documentation:__
Documentation is essential to comprehend software in detail.
However, creating and maintaining documentation is often of low priority to software developers and is viewed as an obstacle.
With my research projects, I aim to streamline these processes.

__Generative Artificial Intelligence and Prompt Engineering:__
During my studies, I create and evaluate software incorporating AI technologies to automate demanding developer tasks like writing documentation.
I currently focus on powerful large language models, like GPT, and aim to optimize their results by applying prompt engineering techniques.

__Empirical Research:__
As a researcher and developer, I focus on practitioners' views.
Therefore, I often apply content analyses, experiments, surveys, interviews as methods to research the requirements and assessments of the people for whom I develop the tools.
